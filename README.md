# HR Attrition Analysis Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes employee data to understand key HR metrics, with a particular focus on employee attrition. The goal is to identify patterns and factors contributing to employees leaving the company by visualizing data related to demographics, performance, satisfaction, and job roles. The insights derived can help inform retention strategies. The analysis covers aspects like overall employee counts, attrition rates, hiring trends, demographic breakdowns, performance tracking, and specific attrition drivers.

## Data Source

* **Dataset:** HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset]
* **Description:** A fictional dataset containing information on 1470 employees, including demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, performance ratings, and attrition status. The data was imported directly into Power BI for analysis.

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Power BI:** Used for data modeling, analysis (DAX measures where applicable), visualization, and dashboard creation. **The dashboard styling utilizes a color scheme inspired by the Valmet company layout/colors.**

## Analysis & Visualizations

The Power BI report is structured into several key sections:

1.  **Overview:** Provides high-level metrics like total employees (1470), active vs. inactive employees, overall attrition rate (16.1%), and employee distribution by department/job role and hiring trends over time.
2.  **Demographics:** Explores employee characteristics such as age distribution (youngest 18, oldest 51), gender, ethnicity, marital status, and average salary ($112.96K).
3.  **Performance Tracker:** Allows tracking of individual or group performance metrics over time, including manager/self-ratings and satisfaction scores (Relationship, Environment, Job, Work-Life Balance).
4.  **Attrition:** Deep dives into attrition patterns, showing attrition rates by year, department/job role, overtime status, business travel frequency, and employee tenure.

## Key Findings & Insights (Examples from the Report)

* The overall attrition rate observed in the dataset is 16.1%.
* Attrition appears higher for employees who work overtime (30.53% rate for 'Yes' vs 10.44% for 'No').
* Attrition rates seem higher in the initial years of employment (0-1 years) and decrease as tenure increases.
* Specific job roles like Sales Representative and Recruiter show higher attrition rates.
* Demographic factors like age, marital status, and ethnicity show varying distributions across the workforce.
